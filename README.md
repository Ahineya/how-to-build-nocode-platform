# Building your own no-code platform

This is a repository with code to supplement the [Build your no-code platform](https://no-code-platform.super.site/) article series by [Pavlo](https://twitter.com/PavloDev).

The Master branch contains the raw boilerplate code. Treat it as an empty project, a starting point for your own platform.

Other branches contain the code for the article series â€” one branch per article.

## Starting the development

You need to have a Node.js runtime installed and a Yarn package manager installed globally.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies
3. Run `yarn start` to start the development server
4. Open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:1234

I have set up a live reload server, so you can see the changes immediately.
